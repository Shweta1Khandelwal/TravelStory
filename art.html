<h1>Rajasthan Arts and Crafts</h1>

<p><center>Rajasthan is well known all over the world for its hand-printed textiles, furniture, leatherwork, jewellery, painting, pottery and metal craft. The use of lively colors and flamboyant, fantasy designs is distinctive in all forms of arts and crafts of Rajasthan.It will be unfair to say that Rajasthani artists only make decorative items. Every household item in Rajasthan proves the statement false as we go through their embellished utensils, colorful attires, unique jewellery designs and embroidered shoes that infuse a new life and a cheerful look to the otherwise monotone of the desert sands.
</center></p>

<h1>Carpets and Dhurries</h1>

Bikaner is also famous for its so-called jail carpets, which are so called for they were once made by the prisoners in the medieval times.
